# Background

The word *economy* comes originally from the Greek *οἰκονομία*, meaning "the management of the household" -- in turn derived from the words οἶκος (*ecos*, house) and νόμος (*nomos*, law or custom).[^1] By relation, it shares a root with the word *ecology*, this time combining οἶκος with the word for study, λογία (*logia*). This notion of economics evoking the well-being of a household or city is sensible, especially when considering the complex questions of land use being debated today. Likewise, the connection between economy and ecology is wise, for while there are considerations for humans in economic questions, there are also considerations of the well-being of the land and its nonhuman inhabitants.

Specifically, the forests of Brazil compose roughly 12% of the world's forest cover. Perhaps more important, those forests -- the Amazon being the best known -- provide the most important carbon sink on earth (helping to naturally control the amound of carbon dixoide and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. In a word, Brazilian forests are *critical* for human well-being in the long term.

Since I lived in Brazil previously and I remember the forests well, this issue is of concern to me both as a resident of earth and as someone with a connection to Brazil. Over the last decade, I have grown increasingly concerned over the policies of the Brazilian government regarding the rainforest.[^2] For example, the Brazilian constitution asserts that the first step twoard claiming land for any kind of development is to clear it -- in practice, allowing for forests to be cut while there is still debate over what to do with a parcel of land (and who has the authority to manage it).

Two major aspects of this seem to get international attention: the rowth of the Brazilian economy and the loss of forests. In plainest terms, I'm asking, *how are these related?*
