Perhaps more important, those forests -- the Amazon being the best known -- provide the most important carbon sink on earth (helping to naturally control the amound of carbon dixoide and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. In a word, Brazilian forests are *critical* for human well-being in the long term.
