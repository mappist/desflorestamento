# Background

The word *economy* comes originally from the Greek *οἰκονομία*, meaning "the management of the household" -- in turn derived from the words οἶκος (*ecos*, house) and νόμος (*nomos*, law or custom).[^1] By relation, it shares a root with the word *ecology*, this time combining οἶκος with the word for study, λογία (*logia*). This notion of economics evoking the well-being of a household or city is sensible, especially when considering the complex questions of land use being debated today. Likewise, the connection between economy and ecology is wise, for while there are considerations for humans in economic questions, there are also considerations of the well-being of the land and its nonhuman inhabitants.

[^1]: Additionally, the word *econometrics* adds the word for "measure," μέτρον.
