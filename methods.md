# Methods

The first methods employed were exploratory.

<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/837076"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

While I did not closely use remote sensing data for this project yet, I did have a chance to view some photo data.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider" data-src="visualisation/5973903"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

After initial plots were made, regression analyses were run. Spatial models (SLM and SEM) did not fit better than a non-spatial OLS regression. However, geographically-weighted regression (GWR) shows some promise, at least fitting better than OLS.
